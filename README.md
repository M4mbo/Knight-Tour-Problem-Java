# Knight's Tour Problem Java
This is my attempt on constructing a solution with visualization of the NP-complete Knight's Tour problem using Java.

The Knight's Tour problem consists of an 8x8 chess board and a knight piece. The goal is to find a sequence of knight moves that visits each tile on the board exactly once.
